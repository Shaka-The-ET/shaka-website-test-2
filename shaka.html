                <p>
                    Each meeting that I have had with Shaka and thier team is published as below. These meetings are presented in different formats shoudl they have been directly related to technology , a sumiiation I was shown or a lesson or pep talk. My side of the transcrption has been edited to sound more interesting but the data and information remains true. Shaks teaching and dialog are unalters. 
                            
                    I am a trained Remote Viewer in a number of diciplincs and have been pracricing for some time.                      
                       When I started this journey all I wated to do was Remote View any Ets out ther are write a short story. I wanted to write in under a psyconym and give it some charm. I started out this way but once I started to interact with Shaka and realised what was going on, and then making an agreement with Shaka to pass on the ofmroaition hewanted, I realised that writing under a psydonym was the wrong thing to do. I have however, kept this arc in the story and you will see ow this get smore serious the further I get into get involved with Shaka.
                       
                       I want to reiterate her that I was not chosen for this, nor is ther anything special. I poked my nose into this arena, making contact with Shaka unexecpedtely (I beleive Shaka new is was happening anyway) and this 'unexpected' discovery took place. Shaka and thier team already have a vast number of poepl they have chosen onth eground to get the assigned iformatiuon out and into the pupulation for thier contact and purpose with hmans on earth. All Shaka has asked me to do is pass on the infromation in my way, as a tech geek and a person who has experience in Remote Viewing.
                   
                       The ifmroation that Shak provides, for exampel the contact scenario, is what they have provided to me. It may be a primary sceario, it may be plab-B, it may change at the last minute. There may be hundered of contact scenarios all at once. Shaka has provided me with this one and I am not expect to know about any other details just as in any comolkicated operation of this kind.
                       
                       Shaka has reitterated that contact with earth form the alliance (you may call it the Galactic Federation or by any name you choose) is a mazzude undertakign and resource intesive task. but, Shaka is firm that we can when they make contact, we can choose or refuse and they will leave us clone, but they will not return again to 'save us' or share technologies, so we better get this right the once and only time.

                       Read through each meeting, tek what you want fom them, beleive it, dont beleive it. Its not my job to convince you. Its my job, as I have agreed with Shaka to pass on the imforamtion as told to. 
                       
                       I would say I knew what I was gettign it. but that was a blasey though on my part. now I am in above my head! Please enjoy.

                    <h3>Who is Shaka the ET</h3>
                    <p>Shaka is a group of 5-6 ETs. They described themselves as a 'collective'. From my interactions I think of them as immensely intelligent, purposeful conscious beings. They are like upper management, facilitators, teachers, implementers. Their primary tasks, in my interactions is to prepare humans for contact and teach their philosophies. They are intently focused on the operation at hand and human contact is immensely important to them. It‚Äôs their primary purpose here.</p>

                    <h3>ET Technologies and Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>ET Technologies and Philosophy
                        Among our meetings Shaka has described a lot of their technologies who that come form the many various ET races that form the alliance. Some of these technologies will be offered to us, some under conditions. I have extracted as many of these technologies out of the meetings and put them onto separate sections and pages for the technical people.</p>
                        
                      <p>  Shaka has also been teaching me their philosophies. I am still learning but essentially they are highly spiritual beings. Their purpose is to find other beings in the universe and provide them with an opportunity to grow, and help them on the path to evolving higher. They believe in brotherhood and they everyone is equal but different and we are all on different paths. Their focus is on preserving and nurturing nature, which is their term for existence and that includes us. They beings all beings should be free.</p>
